# mise Plugin

Last verified: 2026-02-04

## Purpose

Guidance for using mise as a toolchain manager. Covers `mise.toml` (repos you control) and `mise.local.toml` (repos you contribute to).

## Contracts

- **Exposes**: `mise:mise` skill
- **Guarantees**: Skill is standalone, no hooks
- **Expects**: User working with or setting up mise for toolchain management

## Current State

v0.1.0 stub. See `docs/design-notes.md` for planned scope (SessionStart hook, toolchain detection, task runner coverage, cross-plugin coordination).
